#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

// The sstream header defined types which we can use to do in-memory IO
// These types read and write to an underlying std::string as if it was an IO stream.

// We have the std::istringstream which reads a string;
// The std::ostringstream which writes to a string;
// And the std::stringstream which does both.

// These types inherit from the iostream header types (just like fstream).
// These types also introduce some specific operations as well (just like fstream).
